# SGT - Student Grade Table

## Version 0.1
#### Description
Version 0.1 is the starting point of the Student Grade Table Project. LearningFuze has provided a base structure that
includes HTML structure that will need to be updated with boostrap classes. For this version we are looking to see that you
understand how to style an application with bootstrap, take input values and apply them to objects, and update the DOM
with a visual of those objects stored.

## Version 0.5
#### Description
Version 0.5 starts where v.1 left off with adding in the delete functionality. When clicking on the delete button we need to add an event handler that will remove the current row
from the DOM only after we have successfully remove the object from the array.

## Version 1.0
#### Description
Version 1.0 is where we start integrating server data dynamically. When the page loads we will be looking to pull in data through a pre defined API. Once the data hase been received
we will determine if the data is correctly formatted then iterate through the data to display it in the DOM.

## Versions 2.0
#### Description
Version 2.0 is where we start sending data back to the server through a pre defined API to be stored in a database. When a students info is entered it will be sent to the server to be stored. After the student has been added data should be pulled from the server to update your table.
